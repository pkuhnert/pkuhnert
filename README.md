### 👩‍💻 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working in a dual role as Associate Science Director - University Engagement and a Senior Principal Research Scientist.  I have been busy helping to launch the Responsible AI Research Centre or RAIR Centre.  This is a partnership with CSIRO's Data61, the University of Adelaide and the South Australian Government and was launched on the 9th of December 2024. For more information about RAIR see the recent [media announcement](https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/husic/media-releases/new-research-centre-supporting-safe-and-responsible-ai) 

- 🌱 I’m currently exploring new innovations in Agriculture and understanding how machine learning and AI can help advance science in this space to benefit farmers and industry.

### 🌟 Fun Fact

In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family out on the water. I have two boys who enjoy fishing and the outdoors. 
 So every chance we get, we are out on the water. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
